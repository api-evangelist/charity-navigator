The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [Charity Navigator APIs](https://www.charitynavigator.org).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](https://www.charitynavigator.org)- [Developer](https://www.charitynavigator.org)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CharityNav)- [GitHub](https://github.com/CharityNavigator)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/charity-navigator/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the Charity Navigator APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
